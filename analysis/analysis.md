# 🌞# Model Analysis — Solar Energy Power Prediction

This notebook presents the final model evaluation for the solar energy forecasting project. 
The analysis focuses on Linear Regression as the chosen predictive model to estimate DC and AC Power outputs.
## Project Overview

This project predicts **DC Power** and **AC Power** output for a solar power plant using sensor and generation data.
A **Linear Regression model** was developed and evaluated to understand how environmental factors such as irradiation and temperature affect solar power generation.

The goal is to build a simple, interpretable, and efficient predictive model suitable for energy forecasting applications.

## 1. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two CSV files provided by the AICTE–Shell–Edunet internship:

* `Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv` — Contains energy generation data, source keys, and timestamps.
* `Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv` — Contains environmental readings such as irradiation, ambient temperature, and module temperature.

Both datasets were merged on the **DATE_TIME** column to form a unified dataset.
Missing values, duplicates, and outliers were handled appropriately.
Additional time-based features such as `hour`, `day`, and `month` were extracted to capture daily and seasonal trends.

## 2. Objective

The main objectives were:

* **Predict DC Power (Direct Current)** — Raw power generated by solar panels.
* **Predict AC Power (Alternating Current)** — Power delivered after inverter conversion.

### Independent Variables

* AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE
* MODULE_TEMPERATURE
* IRRADIATION
* Time features (hour, day, month)

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Data cleaning and feature engineering were performed before model training.

* Converted timestamps to datetime format.
* Merged weather and generation data on `DATE_TIME`.
* Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
* Extracted `hour`, `day`, `month` features to represent temporal variations.
* Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data[['IRRADIATION', 'AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE', 'MODULE_TEMPERATURE', 'hour', 'day', 'month']]
y_dc = data['DC_POWER']
y_ac = data['AC_POWER']

X_train, X_test, y_train_dc, y_test_dc = train_test_split(X, y_dc, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
_, _, y_train_ac, y_test_ac = train_test_split(X, y_ac, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## 4. Model — Linear Regression

### Theory

Linear Regression assumes a **linear relationship** between the independent variables and the target output.
In the context of solar power generation, it provides a good **baseline model** to understand the trend and relative importance of features like irradiation and temperature.

### Code

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error

linreg_dc = LinearRegression()
linreg_ac = LinearRegression()

linreg_dc.fit(X_train, y_train_dc)
linreg_ac.fit(X_train, y_train_ac)

y_pred_dc = linreg_dc.predict(X_test)
y_pred_ac = linreg_ac.predict(X_test)

r2_dc = r2_score(y_test_dc, y_pred_dc)
r2_ac = r2_score(y_test_ac, y_pred_ac)

print("DC Power R²:", r2_dc)
print("AC Power R²:", r2_ac)
```

## 5. Model Evaluation

| Metric   | DC Power | AC Power |
| :------- | :------: | :------: |
| R² Score |   ~0.78  |   ~0.75  |
| RMSE     |    Low   | Moderate |

### Interpretation

* The model achieved reasonably high R² values, meaning it can explain about 75–80% of the variance in the data.
* Irradiation showed the strongest positive correlation with both DC and AC Power.
* Temperature variations slightly affected efficiency — higher module temperatures led to reduced output.

### Visualization

A residual plot and prediction vs actual plot confirmed that predictions followed the general trend but missed some nonlinear fluctuations due to weather variations.

## 6. Feature Impact Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

coef_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X.columns,
    'Coefficient': linreg_dc.coef_
})

coef_df.sort_values(by='Coefficient', inplace=True)

plt.barh(coef_df['Feature'], coef_df['Coefficient'])
plt.title("Feature Coefficients — DC Power Prediction")
plt.xlabel("Coefficient Value")
plt.ylabel("Feature")
plt.show()
```

**Findings:**

* **IRRADIATION** had the strongest positive influence on DC and AC power.
* **MODULE_TEMPERATURE** had a mild negative influence due to efficiency loss at higher temperatures.
* **Time-based features** helped capture daily solar generation patterns.

## 7. Model Persistence

The trained models were saved for reuse in deployment and analysis.

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(linreg_dc, "../models/dc_linear_model.pkl")
joblib.dump(linreg_ac, "../models/ac_linear_model.pkl")
```

| **Training Speed**           | Very fast                                             |
| **Interpretability**         | Excellent — easy to explain coefficients              |
| **Handling of Nonlinearity** | Limited — struggles with sudden variations            |
| **Use Case**                 | Ideal as a simple, interpretable baseline model       |

### Summary

Linear Regression provided a **transparent and explainable model** for solar power forecasting.
While it cannot capture every nonlinear pattern (like rapid weather changes), it gives a strong baseline for real-world monitoring systems.

The model’s transparency and speed make it a strong foundation for educational, research, and small-scale solar monitoring applications.
